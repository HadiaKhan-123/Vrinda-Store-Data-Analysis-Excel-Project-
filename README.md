# Vrinda-Store-Data-Analysis-Excel-Project-
_Project Overview_

This project involves analyzing the Vrinda Store sales dataset using Microsoft Excel.
The goal of the analysis was to identify customer trends, sales performance, and business insights that can help improve store decision-making.
I followed along with a YouTube tutorial (link here) and then applied the concepts independently on the dataset.

_Tools & Skills Used_

i) Microsoft Excel

ii) Data Cleaning (handling duplicates, missing values, formatting)

iii) Data Analysis using Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

iv) Data Visualization (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, slicers)

v) Dashboard creation

_Key Analysis Performed_

1) Cleaned raw data for consistency (dates, text formatting, missing values).
   
2) Created pivot tables to analyze:
* Sales by Gender
* Sales by Age Group
* Sales by Channel (Online vs Offline)
* Monthly Sales Trends
* Top Contributing States
  
3) Designed an interactive Excel Dashboard to present insights visually.

_Insights & Findings_

i) Women are more likely to buy compared to men.

ii) The age group 30–49 years is the most profitable customer segment.

iii) Most sales come through Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
